Click \"insert to code\" and choose the \"StreamingBody object\" option. After that there will open a pop up which showes you the folder structure of your underlying cloud bucket.

Next you will see a code cell, inserted automatically, that looks like this one except it contains the correct api-keys etc.\n","\n","> It doesn't matter which .json you will choose, because we will later on only use the created client object to access more then only one .json file."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# TMS Data Cleaning (the real part üòâ)\n","\n","We kindof started the cleaning process a bit early with deleting the duplicated rows as described above.
